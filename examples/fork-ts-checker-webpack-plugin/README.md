# fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin / Jest

## Getting started

Forked this to use it but change from yarn to pnpm, that I am going to use.

You'll need [node / npm](https://nodejs.org/) installed.  To get up and running just enter:

```shell
# Download the npm packages you need (including the type definitions from DefinitelyTyped)
pnpm install

# Compile the code and serve it up at http://localhost:8080
pnpm start

# If you'd like to run your tests in watch mode then fire up a separate console and enter this command:
pnpm test:watch 
```

When you're building for production then `pnpm build`. To run tests in CI then `pnpm test`
